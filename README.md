# BlueCoast

This project is carried out by Social Robotics Lab at Uppsala University. We aim to build a system social robotics learning. Currently, this project is at its very initial stage. The README.md is still under development.

## Getting Started

At current stage, we aim to find a way to load pepper's image and display it.

You can use

```
python camera.py
```

to run the first example.

### Prerequisites and Installation

In order to run the program, you need to have a look at development.sh to prepare for the environment.

When the installation script is ready, one can run ./development.sh to install the prerequisite.
```
